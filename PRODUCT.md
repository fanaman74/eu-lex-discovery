## Platform

web

## Users

The general public and press: people without legal training who want to follow EU court rulings on workplace rights. They arrive cold, need to understand in seconds what is tracked, and need a reason to trust it. (Confirmed by the owner, 2 October 2026.)

The owner also operates the site: running source checks, setting the daily schedule, and configuring AI providers.

## Product Purpose

EU Lex Discovery monitors the official EUR-Lex / Cellar source for Court of Justice and General Court decisions touching workplace harassment, psychosocial risk and employment discrimination, and presents each one with its official source link. Success is a visitor finding a recent ruling, understanding what it is about, and reaching the official judgment.

## Positioning

Source-first. Every case links to the official EUR-Lex document, and AI-generated interpretation is stored and shown separately from the source record, labelled as generated, never as a court finding.

## Operating Context

- Cases are discovered by a daily monitor against the EUR-Lex SPARQL endpoint; discovery is a bounded window, not exhaustive coverage.
- Topics are assigned by English keyword match, not legal analysis.
- EUR-Lex titles arrive as one `#`-delimited string (formation and date, parties, subject keywords, case number); the app splits them for display only.
- Publication date is usually not recorded; judgment date is.
- Hosted on Railway with a Neon Postgres database.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- Search and filter by text, topic, court; sort; paginate.
- Case detail: official source, metadata, optional AI summary with verified paragraph citations.
- Monitoring page: manual source check, daily schedule, run history.
- Provider settings: OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Anthropic; keys encrypted server-side.
- In production, write actions require an admin token header and currently fail closed; there is no login.
- Stack: Astro (server output, Node adapter), plain CSS, PostgreSQL.
- Undecided: how operator pages are protected on the public site.

## Brand Commitments

- Name: EU Lex Discovery.
- The standing disclaimer: research support only; always verify against the official judgment.
- The owner rejected the previous navy-and-gold sidebar design as "terrible" and asked for a top menu bar, a large photographic hero, and the five latest cases on the home page with a "view all" action. A plain or timid result is a failure.

## Evidence on Hand

- 84 real cases with official titles, case numbers, courts, dates and source links.
- No AI summaries have been generated yet; none may be invented.
- No testimonials, user counts, or press mentions exist; none may be fabricated.
- Hero photography is sourced from freely licensed photographs with credit.

## Product Principles

1. The official source outranks everything, including the product's own summaries.
2. Say what the data is and is not: bounded discovery, keyword topics, generated interpretation.
3. Plain language for people without legal training; the legal reference stays visible for those who need it.
4. Useful without AI: metadata and source links never depend on a provider.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

Public audience: WCAG AA contrast, full keyboard operation, visible focus, reduced-motion support.
